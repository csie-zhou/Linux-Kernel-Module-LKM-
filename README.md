# Linux-Kernel-Module-LKM

- Design and implement a **Linux Kernel Module** in **C** that manages a virtual character device to facilitate communication **between User Space and Kernel Space.**
- Manage **hardware-software synchronization** using **Spinlocks** and **Mutexes** to prevent race conditions during concurrent I/O operations.
- Implement `mmap` (Memory-Mapped I/O) support to enable zero-copy data transfers, significantly reducing CPU overhead for high-throughput applications.
